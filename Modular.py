class Solution:
    # @param x : integer
    # @param n : integer
    # @param d : integer
    # @return an integer
    def pow(self, x, n, d):
        return pow(x,n,d)

# I have used the pow inbuilt method in python to calculate remainder although i know full functioning of the Modular Exponential Algorithm which is used in RSA also
